## üéµ The Official YARG Setlist

The official *public part* of the setlist for YARG. This repository is here simply to keep track of updates, and to store other important information. If you want to actually play the songs, look in YARG! They should be there. Otherwise, download them from the launcher.

## üõ°Ô∏è License

The YARG setlist **IS NOT** open source. Musicians gave permission to use these songs in YARG specifically. Everything **must** be used exclusively for YARG. Musicians could take action against you if this is not followed.

## ‚ùå Just so I don't waste your time...

The YARG setlist is encrypted, and can only be played in YARG. Attempting to download the songs from this repo is a waste of time. Just play YARG.
